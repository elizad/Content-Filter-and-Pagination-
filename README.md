Treehouse Techdegree Project #2 - Pagination and content filter JavaScript

Requirements

 Since only 10 students should be shown at a time, your programming needs to calculate the number of pages needed and add the appropriate number of links to the bottom of the page.

 Hide all but the first 10 students when the page loads.

 When a user clicks on “next” in the pagination, students 11 through 20 are shown. When a user clicks again “next”, students 21 through 30 are shown. And so on. 


 Users should be able to search by name. And partial matches, like just a first name, should be displayed in the results.

 Search results should also be paginated. For example, if the search returns more than 10 results, those results should be paginated too.

 Include simple animations when transitioning between pages.

 As the user types in the search box, dynamically filter the student listings. In other words, after each letter is typed into the search box, display any listings that match .

 If no matches are found, include a message in the HTML to tell the user there are no matches.
